This folder shares the measurements obtained from the interactions of the regular waves with the flexible beam while the carriage was moving at a constant speed. The free end of the beam is submerged at *0.25*m. This main folder has four sub-folders which correspond to each wave condition. The wave parameters corresponding to each sub-folder are listed in the table given below.
