# Experimental Data for the Experimental Modeling of Water-Wave Interactions with a Flexible Beam

This GitHub repository has been created to share the experimental data which is presented in the OMAE 2023 conference paper 'Experimental Modeling of Water-Wave Interactions with a Flexible Beam'. The paper presents a series of fluid-structure-interaction (FSI) experiments for studying water-wave interactions with a flexible beam in a wide range of sea conditions thus yielding a variety of FSI test-case data. The aim is to use these experimental data in order to validate FSI solvers commonly employed by the maritime industry in the design of fixed-foundation, offshore wind turbines.

The study is divided into three experimental cases which are summarised in the table below


## FSI Experiments: Interactions of water-waves with a flexible beam

All measurements are given in the form of *.h5* format files, each of which has a corresponding *.pan* format file containing details of measurement names, units, frequency, maximum, minimum and standard deviation.
