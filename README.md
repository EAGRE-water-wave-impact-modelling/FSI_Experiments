# Experimental Data for the Experimental Modeling of Water-Wave Interactions with a Flexible Beam

This GitHub repository has been created to share the experimental data which is presented in the OMAE 2023 conference paper 'Experimental Modeling of Water-Wave Interactions with a Flexible Beam'. The paper presents a series of fluid-structure-interaction (FSI) experiments for studying water-wave interactions with a flexible beam in a wide range of sea conditions thus yielding a variety of FSI test-case data. The aim is to use these experimental data in order to validate FSI solvers commonly employed by the maritime industry in the design of fixed-foundation, offshore wind turbines.

The study is divided into three experimental cases which are as follows:

<summary>Case-1 experiments: interactions of regular waves with the flexible beam when the carriage is at rest </summary>

- The experiments are divided into three cases, each of which is aimed at studying the dynamic response of the flexible beam to varying wave conditions ranging from regular-to-irregular and moderate-to-extreme wave height and steepness. Experimental Case 1 concerns interactions of regular waves with the flexible beam when the carriage is at rest; studying this case will facilitate the validation of linear FSI solvers in the non-resonant regime, since the non-linear dynamic response of beam is not excited by the incident-wave frequencies. Experimental Case 2 concerns interactions with the flexible beam when the carriage is moving at a constant speed. Moving the carriage changes the frequency of encounter between beam and waves, so that the dynamic response of the beam and its interaction with water waves, particularly at the onset of resonance, can be studied. By changing the steepness of the regular waves, both linear and nonlinear FSI solvers can be validated.

<summary>Case-3 experiments: interactions of irregular water waves with the flexible beam when the carriage is at rest</summary>

- Experimental Case 3 concerns steep, irregular-wave interactions with the flexible beam when the carriage is at rest. This is the most complex case and is designed to yield data on structural dynamics due to nonlinear wave-loading processes related to steep and breaking waves. This case will help to validate the high-fidelity FSI solvers.
