The results obtained in experimental case~3, when the submerged depth of the beam's free end is *0.25*m, are shared in this folder. The folder has three sub-folders which correspond to each wave condition and are listed in Table 1.

TABLE 1: The wave parameters corresponding to each sub-folder are listed.

In Table 1, H means wave height, T denotes wave time period, Î» is the wavelength, and wave steepness is the ratio of wave height and wavelength.
