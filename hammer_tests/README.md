A hammer test is an experimental method for measuring a structure's natural response/frequency. This folder shares the *.h5m* files obtained from the dry and wet hammer tests. The file **dry_004_01.h5m** contains accelerations of the beam when the hammer test is performed in the air. A dry hammer test is performed to obtain the natural frequency of the beam in the air when it is unaffected by the water. The wet hammer tests are performed when the beam is submerged. The purpose of wet hammer tests is to observe the effect of water on the natural frequency of the beam, therefore, wet hammer tests are performed with two depths of the submerged beam's end, that is, *0.25*m and *0.5*m. The file **wet1_001_01.h5m** and **wet2_006_01.h5m** corresponds to the wet hammer tests with submerged end depths of *0.25*m and *0.5*m respectively. The code to read the *.h5m* files is **comp_hammer_test_h5.m**. The code also contains comments to assist the user's understanding. The obtained results are shared in the form of **.fig** files.
