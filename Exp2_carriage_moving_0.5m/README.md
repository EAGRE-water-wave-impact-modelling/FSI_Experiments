The results obtained in experimental case 2 when the submerged depth of the beam's free end is *0.5*m are shared in this folder. The folder has four sub-folders which correspond to each wave condition and are listed in Table 1.

TABLE 1: The wave parameters corresponding to each sub-folder are listed.
| Folder   name |   H   |  T  | λ | Steepness (H/λ) |  Speed  | Encounter frequency |

In Table 1, H means wave height, T denotes wave time period, λ is the wavelength, and wave steepness is the ratio of wave height and wavelength.
